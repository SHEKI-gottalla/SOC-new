        <p class="text-white-50">HISTOGRAM</p>
        <p class="text-white-50">A histogram is a display of statistical information that uses rectangles to show the frequency of data items in successive numerical intervals of equal size. In the most common
           form of histogram, the independent variable is plotted along the horizontal axis and the dependent variable is plotted along the vertical axis.

                 <p class="text-white-50">CAUSE AND EFFECT DIAGRAM</p>
                 <p class="text-white-50">A cause and effect diagram examines why something happened or might happen by organizing potential causes into smaller categories. It can also be useful for showing relationships between contributing factors. One of the Seven Basic Tools of Quality, it is often referred to as a fishbone diagram or Ishikawa diagram.

                    <p class="text-white-50">A defect concentration diagram is a visual representation—usually, a diagram or map—which shows all defects or problem areas in what is being analyzed. As a research tool, it may began as a blank diagram or picture, in which problem locations are marked down as they happen or are discovered.

                       <p class="text-white-50">A checklist is a type of job aid used to reduce failure by compensating for potential limits of human memory and attention. It helps to ensure consistency and completeness in carrying out a task. A basic example is the "to do list"

                          <p class="text-white-50">Control charts, also known as Shewhart charts or process-behavior charts, are a statistical process control tool used to determine if a manufacturing or business process is in a state of control. It is more appropriate to say that the control charts are the graphical device for Statistical Process Monitoring
